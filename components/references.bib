abstract = {SUMMARY:  Phylogenetic comparative methods are essential for addressing evolutionary hypotheses with interspecific data. The scale and scope of such data have increased dramatically in the past few years. Many existing approaches are either computationally infeasible or inappropriate for data of this size. To address both of these problems, we present geiger v2.0, a complete overhaul of the popular R package geiger. We have reimplemented existing methods with more efficient algorithms and have developed several new approaches for accomodating heterogeneous models and data types.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:  This R package is available on the CRAN repository http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geiger/. All source code is also available on github http://github.com/mwpennell/geiger-v2. geiger v2.0 depends on the ape package.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT:   mwpennell@gmail.com SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {The accelerating growth of data and knowledge in evolutionary biology is indisputable. Despite this rapid progress, information remains scattered, poorly documented and in formats that impede discovery and integration. A grand challenge is the creation of a linked system of all evolutionary data, information and knowledge organized around Darwin's ever-growing Tree of Life. Such a system, accommodating topological disagreement where necessary, would consolidate taxon names, phenotypic and geographical distributional data across clades, and serve as an integrated community resource. The field of evolutionary informatics, reviewed here for the first time, has matured into a robust discipline that is developing the conceptual, infrastructure and community frameworks for meeting this grand challenge.},

               without a central database to store what we know about
               historical patterns and evolutionary relationships. TreeBASE was
               developed to harness this information and to provide a tool to
               study the evolution of biodiversity. Access to phylogenetic
               trees, and to the data underlying them, is needed for a wide
               variety of purposes, including comparative studies of
               morphological and molecular evolution, biogeography,
               coevolution, and studies of congruence of results based on
               different sources of evidence. Such data are also needed to
               monitor progress in phylogenetic research, to test new methods
               of analysis, and to address immediate practical problems in
               conservation of biodiversity. TreeBASE stores published
               phylogenetic trees, character and molecular data matrices,
               bibliographic information, and some details on taxa, characters,
               algorithms used, and analyses performed. The database is
               designed to be explored interactively and to allow retrieval and
               recombination of trees and data from different studies. TreeBASE
               therefore provides a means of assessing and synthesizing

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:A hierarchical taxonomy of organisms is a prerequisite
              for semantic integration of biodiversity data. Ideally, there
              would be a single, expansive, authoritative taxonomy that
              includes extinct and extant taxa, information on synonyms and
              common names, and monophyletic supraspecific taxa that reflect
              our current understanding of phylogenetic
              relationships.Description As a step towards development of such a
              resource, and to enable large-scale integration of phenotypic
              data across vertebrates, we created the Vertebrate Taxonomy
              Ontology (VTO), a semantically defined taxonomic resource derived
              from the integration of existing taxonomic compilations, and
              freely distributed under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) public
              domain waiver. The VTO includes both extant and extinct
              vertebrates and currently contains 106,947 taxonomic terms, 22
              taxonomic ranks, 104,736 synonyms, and 162,400 cross-references
              to other taxonomic resources. Key challenges in constructing the
              VTO included (1) extracting and merging names, synonyms, and
              identifiers from heterogeneous sources; (2) structuring
              hierarchies of terms based on evolutionary relationships and the
              principle of monophyly; and (3) automating this process as much
              as possible to accommodate updates in source
              taxonomies.CONCLUSIONS:The VTO is the primary source of taxonomic
              information used by the Phenoscape Knowledgebase
              (http://phenoscape.org/), which integrates genetic and
              evolutionary phenotype data across both model and non-model
              vertebrates. The VTO is useful for inferring phenotypic changes
              on the vertebrate tree of life, which enables queries for
              candidate genes for various episodes in vertebrate evolution.",
